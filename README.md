# Time-Series
Time series analysis comprises methods for analyzing time series data in order to extract meaningful statistics and other characteristics of the data. Time series forecasting is the use of a model to predict future values based on previously observed values.

Time series are widely used for non-stationary data, like economic, weather, stock price, and retail sales in this post. We will demonstrate different approaches for forecasting retail sales time series.

We live in a world of time series. Historical data is simply the starting point of the deep learning process, which is why applying AI to time series analysis is one of the more exciting recent innovations in the space. With 5G and the IoT, a wealth of data is about to be unlocked across the globe, and with time-series AI significant benefits can be realized across all kinds of verticals for all kinds of populations.
